# Exercise 3

## Instructions

The main goal of this exercise is to learn basic java syntax. We will also learn how to read the [Java Language Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/index.html) and [Java API specification](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/index.html)

### `Exercise` Java Basic syntax

1. In repository devops21_java [lesson_3](https://gitlab.com/robert-alfwar/devops21_java/-/tree/main/lesson_3)

2. Write a class that uses a `switch`.

3. Write a class `Circle` that calculates the `area`, `circumference` and holds a variable `radius`.

4. Write a `while` loop that uses a `break` or `continue`.
