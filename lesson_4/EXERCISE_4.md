# Exercise 4

## Instructions

The main goal of this exercise is to learn Java class syntax and object oriented design. 

### Group `Exercise` Object Oriented Java

- Pick a design problem, e.g.
-- A simulator to drive different vehicles
-- A game where you take care of a small zoo
-- A simple HR system with managers and employees that can be hired or let go
-- A simple webshop system that sells hats
-- A document writing app with support for different blocks such as text, images, videos and tables
-- A simple software to represent running on different models of a system camera (a camera with interchangable lenses)
-- Or come up with your own idea of a real world problem to design

For your design problem, do:
1. Write down at least 10 nouns or verbs that are important to represent the problem in software
2. Define at least 3 different classes and 1 interface from these words
3. Draw on paper ![a diagram like this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/uml/images/uml_class_diagram.jpg) that shows how the classes interact (inheritance, methods and fields)
4. Take a photo of your final design (or digitalize it some other way) and share with all team members
5. If time allows: present to the class

### Individual `Exercise`

Take the design from the group and write it as a set of minimal Java code files. Ensure you have somewhere used the keywords `extends`, `implements`, `@Override` for inheritance, and `public`, `private` for encapsulation. The code should compile (no warnings in editor) but no logic is needed - the methods don't need to *do* anything, no objects need to be instantiated.

Hand in the Java files.

## Hand in instructions

### General hand in instructions

- Create a branch with name `YOURUSERNAME_lesson_4`

Hand in your exercise in a `Pull Request` that contains screenshot[s] and file[s]. You can also use the feature `attach a file` for screenshots in your `Pull Request`

### What to hand in

In the repository [devops22-java](https://github.com/fictive-reality/devops22-java)

Hand in files:

- All classes created in different packages
