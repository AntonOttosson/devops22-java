# Exercise 4

## Instructions

The main goal of this exercise is to learn basic java class syntax.

### `Exercise` Java Basic Class Syntax

1. In repository devops22-java
2. Create a sub folder so you can have classes in separate packages.

    ```text
    folder
    \
     subfolder
    ```

3. Create a Main class in a subfolder that you should instantiate classes created in step 5, 6.

    ```Java
    package folder.subfolder;

    class Main {

    }
    ```

4. Create a Main class in the folder above subfolder.

    ```Java
    
    class Main {

    }

    ```

5. Create a interface in your subfolder and write a class that implement it.

6. Create a class in the subfolder that is extended (used as a superclass) from another package. i.e subfolder2

    ```text
    folder
    \
     subfolder
     subfolder2
    ```

7. In both Main files, initiate classes and execute a method.

8. Hand in the actual files.
